Hello! I hope you like my version the Meltmedia css test. I just want to point
out a few things. To be able to use the Adelle font that was in the photoshop
file, I had to use the Typekit API which has a little lag, sadly.

I was very tempted to put the links into a hamburger menu for mobile,
but I've been trying to break that habit and only hide elements when
its completely necessary. I think my solution is a good compromise. 

As far as optimization, I optimized all of the images. I normally would minify
the css, but I figured you would want to look at that. I kept my scss file as well.
I would also normally run the whole css file through https://autoprefixer.github.io/
so I have all of the appropriate prefixes for full browser support. But, that would
make the css file harder to read and I wanted you to have no problem looking through
my code so I left that step out.

I think thats it! I look forward to hearing from you.
